;; vim-fireplace (and maybe others?) frequently close and reopen the
;; nREPL TCP/IP connection -- perhaps after each command? -- and yet
;; expect their session id to be valid across connections.  That didn't
;; work for my initial catapult approach, which created a new Drawbridge
;; client for each incoming nREPL connection (this constantly creating
;; new sessions on the Drawbridge server).
;;
;; Among other things, messages sent in between nREPL TCP/IP connections
;; were sent on a session that would never be seen again and so the
;; vim-fireplace REPL would almost immediately stall.
;;
;; The solution is to use a single Drawbridge client and then map
;; multiple incoming nREPL TCP/IP connections onto that client.  The
;; trick is that we need to know which session id(s) are on each TCP/IP
;; connection so that we can properly route responses from Drawbridge
;; back to each TCP/IP connection.

;; catapult-engine has two states: proxying messages, and creating a new
;; session.  In the former, we just copy messages back and forth.  In
;; the latter, we still copy messages from Drawbridge back to the
;; session channels, but we don't accept new requests until the new
;; session has been created.  This is because multiple nREPL TCP/IP
;; connections could be open and, in theory, they could try to clone new
;; sessions simultaneously.  By going synchronous during session
;; creation we ensure that we learn the new session id.
;;
;; nrepl-engine creates a single channel for itself and sends that in to
;; every catapult-engine request.  Then the catapult engine can either
;; send back the synchronous :new-session response or just make the
;; received channel the interested party for the session that was in the
;; request (bumping out any other channel that might have been there in
;; case of a reconnect).
;;
;; One issue here is that we might keep putting things into a closed
;; channel if the nREPL TCP/IP connection dies without reading
;; everything from the last session.  Unsolicited data is certainly
;; possible (from a future, for example), so we probably can't ignore
;; this problem.
;;
;; I think that we should detect a closed channel and create a new
;; temporary buffer channel in that situation.  Then when an nREPL
;; connection comes along again we flush the temporary buffer channel
;; into that new nREPL channel before swapping in the new channel.
;;
;; For now though we will assume that nREPL TCP/IP connections consume
;; all of the data and so we won't get writes into a closed channel.
;; This seems to work for vim-fireplace.
